The old professor collected rare books in his tiny study, carefully placing each volume on wooden shelves that reached from floor to ceiling, their leather bindings releasing that wonderful scent of aged paper and wisdom whenever someone opened the door, and he would spend countless hours reading passages aloud to his cat, a fluffy orange creature who seemed to appreciate the rhythm of the words more than their meaning, particularly enjoying the longer sentences about distant lands and magical creatures that the professor found in his most cherished nineteenth-century editions, though honestly the cat probably just liked watching the dust motes dance in the afternoon sunlight streaming through the window while his owner's voice provided a soothing background hum, making this cramped room feel like the coziest place in the entire world despite being cluttered with stacks of books on every available surface including the floor.
